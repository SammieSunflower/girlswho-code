<h2>
Married in a Gold Rush
</h2>
<p>
<div>Something's happening in the country</div>
<div>And the government's to blame</div>
<div>We got married in a gold rush</div>
<div>And the rush has never felt the same</div>
<div>Shared a moment in a cafe</div>
<div>Shared a kiss in pouring rain</div>
<div>We got married in a gold rush</div>
<div>And the sight of gold will always bring me pain</div>
<div>I don't wanna hear the rumors, please don't say it loud</div>
<div>I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud</div>
<div>Boy, who's your baby?</div>
<div>Girl, if you don't know by now</div>
<div>There's two seats on the midnight train</div>
<div>The gold won't weigh us down</div>
<div>Hanging gardens turned to desert</div>
<div>All that loving turned to hate</div>
<div>We got married in a gold rush</div>
<div>And those wedding bells were ringing out our fate</div>
<div>I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud</div>
<div>I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud</div>
<div>Boy, who's your baby?</div>
<div>Girl, if you don't know by now</div>
<div>There's two seats on the midnight train</div>
<div>The gold won't weigh us down</div>
<div>The rush is on to somewhere else, we're running out of time</div>
<div>Everything was ours, now it's just an empty mine</div>
<div>Animals don't understand the words on the danger sign</div>
<div>For them, it's just some shade from the morning shine</div>
<div>I thought you might learn the language</div>
<div>I thought you might learn to sing</div>
<div>We were born before the gold rush</div>
<div>So why can't I remember anything?</div>
<div>I want to put things back together</div>
<div>I wanna give, I don't wanna take</div>
<div>Time to disavow the gold rush</div>
<div>And the bitterness that's flourished in its wake</div>
<div>I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud</div>
<div>Please don't say it loud</div>
<div>I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud</div>
<div>Boy, who's your baby?</div>
<div>Girl, if you don't know by now</div>
<div>There's two seats on the midnight train</div>
<div>The gold won't weigh us down</div>
<div>I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud</div>
<div>Please don't say it loud</div>
<div>I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud</div>
<div>Boy, who's your baby?</div>
<div>Girl, if you don't know by now</div>
<div>There's two seats on the midnight train</div>
<div>The gold won't weigh us down</div>
