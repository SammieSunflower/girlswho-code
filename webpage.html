About me:
</h3>
<p>
Hello! I am an upcoming  junior as of september of 2019. Currently, I have not looked into schools, although I probably should have. Anyway, I play soccer for my school team as well as a club team. I am a sister to four other siblings, of which I am the second youngest. In my free time, I prefer to be hanging out by myself listening to music on youtube or pandora.
