You go outside to play by the chicken coop by yourself. Suddenly, two chicks walk up to you. It’s Donald and Daisy.
Donald says “ Your different! Your feathers look funny.”
Daisy says “You are just an annoying duck. Grow up already!”
You scream “Leave me alone!” and run away.
You come across a path that splits into two. The left one leads to the forest and the right one to the boardwalk.
